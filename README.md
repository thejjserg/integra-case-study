## JR. Product Owner: Case Study

Instructions: Review the scenarios and related tasks. Choose your preferred presentation tool(s) to share this exercise and answer related questions. 

### Scenario:
You are the Junior Product Owner responsible for managing a Tier 1 support team that handles day-to-day user requests for a cloud-based application. Over the past month, your team has received an increasing number of support tickets related to intermittent login failures. While these issues are being resolved individually, the volume of tickets is growing, and some users are becoming frustrated with the frequency of this problem.
Your role is to determine how best to address this situation and ensure it doesn’t become a recurring issue.

### Tasks:

1.	Data Analysis and Trend Identification:
Analyze the data from the past month’s support tickets. You notice that many login failure issues come from specific user groups, particularly those accessing the system during peak hours. There are similarities in the error messages these users report, suggesting a potential pattern or underlying issue.
•	What specific data would you prioritize further to investigate the root cause of these login failures?
•	Based on the data, what trends can you identify, and how would you use this information to escalate the issue to the Tier 3 support team for further investigation?

2.	Escalation to Tier 3 Support:
You need to escalate this issue to the Tier 3 team, which handles more complex technical problems. However, to ensure the team understands the severity and scope of the problem, you must provide them with a clear and detailed report.
•	What information would you include in your escalation report to ensure the Tier 3 team can effectively address the issue?
•	How would you prioritize the information to ensure they have everything they need to resolve the issue quickly?

3.	Independent Problem Solving and Communication:
In addition to working with your team and escalating the issue to Tier 3, you want to ensure that communication with stakeholders and end users remains clear. You also want to propose a long-term solution to avoid similar login issues in the future.
•	What independent steps would you take to address the problem comprehensively beyond escalating the issue?
•	How would you communicate the current status and next steps to stakeholders and end users, ensuring transparency and trust?
•	What strategies would you use to engage stakeholders and gather all necessary details to help the Tier 1 team thoroughly review an issue before escalation?



4.	Documentation & KPI Tracking:
One of your responsibilities is to ensure that the documentation for the support process is kept up to date. As part of this, you need to create a detailed user guide and troubleshooting document for login-related issues.
•	How would you structure the documentation to ensure that it is both comprehensive and easy to follow for future Tier 1 support agents and end users?
•	Include an example outline of the key sections and information you would add to the documentation.
•	One of the KPI for the Tier 1 team will be to meet the SLAs outlined for each issue-type. What methods can be used measure if the team is meeting their SLA goals? If the team is failing to meet the SLA timelines, how might you bring visibility to the issue and what actions might you suggest the team take?
